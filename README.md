## Space Engineers intergrid communication proposal
This is proposal for possible integration of inter-grid communication to Space Engineers game.

System is based on embedded like system model connected via antenna communication network where programmable blocks act as a communication endpoints and controller for each connected grid.

Main objective of this project is to setup communication interface for scripting API. Everyone interested is welcomed to contribute. 

The rest of the repository contains actual showcases and programmable block side of sample implementation demonstrating ability to implement such functionality to the game TODAY with minimal effort and to allow anyone to try this proposal on their own, live, and give me a valuable feedback.

The rest of the sample implementation is available as a game mode here:
